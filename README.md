# Weather Report

## This Repo

This repository is in regards to the Weather Report application developed as Homework 6 in Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. It is designed to use the Open Weather API to pull and display the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast. When a city is searched, it is added to Local Storage and the option to get the weather again for that city is given via a button underneath the search form.

I used 2 separate API calls, one via a different Open Weather API that allowed the use of a city parameter and then fed the lat/long from that data to the the onecall API to return the data used in the deployed application.

Ideas for the future include: a toggle to display the data in different units (this only gives back imperial, not metric) as well as a pretty banner image to display in the banner depending on the current weather.
